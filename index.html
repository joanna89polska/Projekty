    <h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
    <h2>BY ROBERT FROST</h2>
    <p>Some say the world will end in fire,<br>
        Some say in ice.<br>
        From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire<br>
        I hold with those who favor fire.<br>
        But if it had to perish twice,<br>
        I think I know enough of hate<br>
        To say that for destruction ice<br>
        Is also great<br>
        And would suffice.</p>
